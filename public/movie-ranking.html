<H1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO IFEANYI</H1>


<h2>My TOP MOVIES OF ALL TIME</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>FORD N FERRARI</h3>
<p>This movie was one of the best movies that came out in 2019. I watched it during covid 19 and it was very intresting to me as a car enthusiast</p>

<h3>AVENGERS:INFINITY WAR</h3>
<p>This movie was (in my opinion) one of the best movies to have been produced from the marvel franchise </p>

<h3>WALL-E</h3>
<p>This movie was one of the best movies to have been produced by Pixar. It was a very emotional movie for me. This is due to the fact that when i first watched it as a child i did not know what it was talking about. But, when i watched it now (as an adult) i made me realize that Wall-e and me have very similar situations
